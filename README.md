# Oxidized Selenium

This is a template repo for [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/eframe), a framework for writing apps using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/).

The goal is for this to be the simplest way to get started writing a GUI app in Rust.

You can compile your app natively or for the web, and share it using Github Pages.
